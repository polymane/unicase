As your implementation is for emfcp only you can and must Close all   
Plugins except Navigator Editor ui.Common navigatoreditor Bridge. I   
hope i didnt forget one.

# Questions:
- Can we please use the org.unicase.metamodel package? We need it for the "NonDomainElement" and "AssociationClassElement". Otherwise I would have to implement the Classes in a util class.
- With what content should we use the "Browse Workspace" package if the workspace is only ourselves?
- What method is called on which object when you press (the already implemented) "Delete" right-clicking a project in the Navigator? Or how can I link "Delete" to the DeleteProjectHandler?
- Why are still all models displayed when you open up "New Model Elements"? I thought this would have been fixed?! Or How do we register our model correctly?
- listener to refresh the navigator -> project/workspace listener… -> Markus
- Consolidate Delete: Consolidate Menu -> e.g. remove "Delete", Folder-Entries, ...
- Import dialog: there might be a dialog in eclipse to shortcut to the workspace (directly browse the workspace -> example: reload genmodel)

- Usecase: delete project-file from disk without deleting it in the workspace ->
	 resource.load automatically creates a new project-file!

- where to to get a platform specific slash from?

- @ Project Generator Team: they save the file the wrong way, the registered model is XMI which is no valid model
	--> How do you sav your model?
