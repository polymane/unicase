## TODO

29.12.	Matti	OK	Change Design -> Refactor, make the Commands do the work, not the Dialogs!

29.12.	Matti	OK	Folder shouldn’t be shown in the navigator -> the workspace should shortcut it to the projects in the folder

26.12.	Matti	OK	Feature request: for notes l. 11+12 (ECP Folder Structure done) -> Markus

26.12.	Matti	OK	We shouldn’t have dependencies on the workspace package -> remove dependencies (also look for other dependencies that can be removed!) -> Markus

# Accepted plugins:
# Message extract from Nov 15, 18.35h @ XMI/MemoryLeak Group Channel

As your implementation is for emfcp only you can and must Close all   
Plugins except Navigator Editor ui.Common navigatoreditor Bridge. I   
hope i didnt forget one.

# Questions:
Ok - Can we please use the org.unicase.metamodel package? We need it for the "NonDomainElement" and "AssociationClassElement". Otherwise I would have to implement the Classes in a util class.
Ok - With what content should we use the "Browse Workspace" package if the workspace is only ourselves?
Ok - What method is called on which object when you press (the already implemented) "Delete" right-clicking a project in the Navigator? Or how can I link "Delete" to the DeleteProjectHandler?
- Why are still all models displayed when you open up "New Model Elements"? I thought this would have been fixed?! Or How do we register our model correctly?
- listener to refresh the navigator -> project/workspace listener… -> Markus
Ok - Consolidate Delete: Consolidate Menu -> e.g. remove "Delete", Folder-Entries, ...
Ok - Import dialog: there might be a dialog in eclipse to shortcut to the workspace (directly browse the workspace -> example: reload genmodel)

- Usecase: delete project-file from disk without deleting it in the workspace ->
	 resource.load automatically creates a new project-file!

Ok - where to to get a platform specific slash from?

--
- @ Project Generator Team: they save the file the wrong way, the registered model is XMI which is no valid model
	--> How do you save your model?

# Todo:
- Dialogs and Handlers
	-> If project-file name/location.. is empty : now only error in console but should be a message dialog
	-> Test functionallity
	-> see TODOs
- refactor init() in XMIFileProjectImpl to Getter methods!
- Problem: File changed on file system or has been deleted
	-> add a status to the project in form of an enumeration with the values LOADED, NOTLOADED, FAILEDTOLOAD
	-> Change the ItemProvider so it asks the project for its status and changes the icon/text if FAILEDTOLOAD
	-> popupmenu needs to get a PropertyTester (new class) and then execute a Dialog where it asks the user what to do with the failed Projects (Import/Delete/New).
Ok - Remove commented code where metamodel-package-usage is marked and add a comment behind the return that this plugin does not support Associations, etc.
Ok - Send a Patch to Jonas from the navigator-package -> Delete in Menu-Issue
Ok - Change the Import- and New-Project-Dialog so the emf.common...ResourceDialog with the Eclipse-Navigator-Workspace-Content can be used.
- The Slash is File.SEPARATOR .
- In the XMIWorkspace call getProjects() instead of directly addressing the projects, because of the change listeners for the Navigator.
Ok - Send a Bug-Report to Jonas that if there are no packages registered for the application, the "New Model Element"-Dialog is strange...
