#Todo:
- All models are displayed when you open up "New Model Element" on any project.
	It should be that in a new project, all models are displayed so the user can pick its model,
	but in an existing model only the model itself is shown.
	
- Delete menu entry does not work for baseElements
	see plugin.xml from ui.common where the "Delete" command is added,
	in our plugin.xml adding it was not successful and we can't extend
	the org.unicase.common.commands.DeleteModelElementCommand due to
	keyword final of the class
	The problem is that the EObjects don't know the project and therefore
	they will not be removed from the baseElements list.
	
	Added stuff to fix this:
		- class DeleteModelelement in commands
		- icons -> delete_element.gif
		- changed plugin.xml, but reverted it after seeing that it didn't work

# Accepted plugins:
# Message extract from Nov 15, 18.35h @ XMI/MemoryLeak Group Channel

As your implementation is for emfcp only you can and must Close all   
Plugins except Navigator Editor ui.Common navigatoreditor Bridge. I   
hope i didnt forget one.

- @ Project Generator Team: they save the file the wrong way, the registered model is XMI which is no valid model
	--> How do you save your model?

# Resolved:
29.12.	Matti	OK	Change Design -> Refactor, make the Commands do the work, not the Dialogs!
29.12.	Matti	OK	Folder shouldn't be shown in the navigator -> the workspace should shortcut it to the projects in the folder
26.12.	Matti	OK	Feature request: for notes l. 11+12 (ECP Folder Structure done) -> Markus
26.12.	Matti	OK	We shouldn't have dependencies on the workspace package -> remove dependencies (also look for other dependencies that can be removed!) -> Markus
26.12.	Matti	OK	Saving the (workspace-) file to an other place for example where the runtime is!
26.12.	Matti	OK	Use own command instead of unicase command in the dialog
OK - Remove DeleteFolderHandler
Ok - Can we please use the org.unicase.metamodel package? We need it for the "NonDomainElement" and "AssociationClassElement". Otherwise I would have to implement the Classes in a util class.
Ok - With what content should we use the "Browse Workspace" package if the workspace is only ourselves?
Ok - What method is called on which object when you press (the already implemented) "Delete" right-clicking a project in the Navigator? Or how can I link "Delete" to the DeleteProjectHandler?
Ok - listener to refresh the navigator -> project/workspace listeners
Ok - Consolidate Delete: Consolidate Menu -> e.g. remove "Delete", Folder-Entries, ...
Ok - Import dialog: there might be a dialog in eclipse to shortcut to the workspace (directly browse the workspace -> example: reload genmodel)
Ok - Usecase: delete project-file from disk without deleting it in the workspace ->
	 resource.load automatically creates a new project-file!
Ok - where to to get a platform specific slash from?
Ok - Dialogs and Handlers
	 -> If project-file name/location.. is empty : now only error in console but should be a message dialog
Ok - Command Exceptions when invoking New, Import and delete
OK - refactor init() in XMIFileProjectImpl to Getter methods!
Ok - File changed on file system or has been deleted
	OK -> add a status to the project in form of an enumeration with the values LOADED, NOTLOADED, FAILEDTOLOAD
	OK -> Change the ItemProvider so it asks the project for its status and changes the icon/text if FAILEDTOLOAD
		-> also changed icon added
Ok - Remove commented code where metamodel-package-usage is marked and add a comment behind the return that this plugin does not support Associations, etc.
Ok - Send a Patch to Jonas from the navigator-package -> Delete in Menu-Issue
Ok - Change the Import- and New-Project-Dialog so the emf.common...ResourceDialog with the Eclipse-Navigator-Workspace-Content can be used.
Ok - The Slash is File.SEPARATOR .
Ok - In the XMIWorkspace call getProjects() instead of directly addressing the projects, because of the change listeners for the Navigator.
	-> This does not work, listener adapters in TreeView register on us and they need to be called when changed!
Ok - Send a Bug-Report to Jonas that if there are no packages registered for the application, the "New Model Element"-Dialog is strange...
OK - File changed on file system or has been deleted
	OK -> popupmenu needs to get a PropertyTester (new class) and then execute a Dialog where it asks the user what to do with the failed Projects (Import/Delete/New).
	OK -> Add icon to Resolve command
	OK -> plugin.xml: for deleted project only one popup menu entry: "resolve"
OK - refactor workspace -> remove folder items
