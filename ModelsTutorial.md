# Tutorial Models 2010 #

The following metarial was used for the tutorial hosted on Models 2010. Please use a Eclipse Galileo Modeling Edition. Install the update site and import the example model. The example solution contains the same plugins from the example model, but with the completed tasks from the tutorial. If you want to look at the solution, you should use a second workspace for that. Please contact us, if you have any questions.
