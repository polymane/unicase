The EMFStore Framework delivers the following features for your application:

  * A model repository supporting **offline operation** and **interactive merging**
  * Built-in persistence for your models on client and server side
  * Client-side API for updating your model or synchronizing your model with the repository
  * Views for showing the repository, the models, the history and to commit/update and merge your models
  * **Automated migration support** for model instances if you change your Ecore model

=> You can build an EMF-based application where users can collaborate on models by just providing an Ecore model.

[This video](EMFStoreDemo.md) shows an application built on the EMFStore framework to demonstrate its features. Addtionally we have prepared a [screenshot gallery](EMFStoreScreenshotGallery.md).
