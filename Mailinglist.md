# Mailing-lists and Calendar #
We have mailing-lists and a calendar for the UNICASE development.

## Mailing-lists ##
There are three mailing-lists for UNICASE: the **Developer Mailing-list**, the **User Mailing-list** and the **Bug Mailing-list**.

### Developer Mailing-list ###
The **Developer Mailing-list** is intended for communication with and among UNICASE developers and for asking questions about the development of UNICASE. Every member of the list can post messages but you need to subscribe before posting. Before posting a question to the list please consider the [FAQ](http://code.google.com/p/unicase/wiki/FAQ).
This list is a must for any UNICASE developer.
