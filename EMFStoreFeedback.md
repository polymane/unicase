We highly appreciate your input to improve EMFStore. You are the our most valuable source of bug reports and feature requests. If you find a bug or if you have feature request please do not hesitate to report it to us. Please give us as much information on the feature or bug as you can, in particular the following information is very useful to us in descending order of priority:

  * The version of EMFStore the problem occured in
  * Steps to reproduce the problem
  * User Environment: Eclipse version, Java version, OS
  * A screenshot of the error or problem
  * A log entry of the problem
  * A zipped copy of your emfstore data folder (default is .unicase in your user home)

Some things are explained faster and better in a video showing the contents of your screen. There are very easy ways to record a screencast including audio:

  * [Screenr](http://screenr.com): Web application that can be launched from a web browser without installation, only requires a [Twitter](http://twitter.com) account
  * [Jing](http://www.jingproject.com/): Desktop application that shares a video via screencast with on mouse click, very easy to use
  * [Windows Problem Steps Reporter](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rv5vvwCYMU): If you are a Windows 7 user, it already ships with a tool for this purpose.
