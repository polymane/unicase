### Tutorial for users ###
Create a new element "UseCase" from the package "usecase" in UNICASE. The element has several attributes, e.g. pre- and post condition, rules, linked actors, included use cases and system functions etc. Navigate to the new page "Flow of Events". Within the Flow of Events, add Human Steps and IT System Steps.

Each step can be linked to another step. Human Steps can have several options. Each option can be linked to another IT System Step. On the right side, additional information is displayed to support the creation of the Flow of Events.
