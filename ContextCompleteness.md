## Description ##
This plugin provides support for identifying incomplete elements, e.g. isolated elements or elements missing certain mandatory links to other elements. Results can be saved for later usage and exported to Excel. The context of a particular element can be shown, which means all linked elements of the originating element with ability to directly navigate to linked elements.

Open the view "Context Tree" in Eclipse: Eclipse Menu -> Window -> Show View -> Other -> Unicase -> Context Tree.

The view "Context Tree" shows the context of a particular element in a tree structure. The context consists of all directly linked elements. One can drill down within these linked elements, as well.
