### Quick Start Guide ###
When you start the plug-in for the first time, no custom views are defined. In order to create a user-defined view, click on the UNICASE Views Icon on the navigator's toolbar in the UNICASE perspective and select "Manage Views". This will open a dialog in which you can create, edit and remove views. Clicking on "New" will open the "Define View" dialog, in which you can define a custom view. Click on "Add" to add types that are to be shown in the new view. Click on "Save" once you are satisfied with your selection. You can save the new view by clicking on "Save". Your newly created view should be visible in the "Manage Views" dialog. You can apply the view either by selecting it in the dialog and the clicking on "Apply selected" or by selecting it from the "Custom Views" submenu.
