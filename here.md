### Action Items in the code: TaskTags ###
<br>
To add ActionItems to the code we use to use TaskTags. A TaskTag is a magic comment, preconfigured are "TODO", "FIXME" and "XXX". You can define your own task tags in the Preferences, Java -> Compiler -> TaskTags (see screenshot below). Unfortunatelly the tags can not be exported to my knowledge. You should add at least a TaskTag for your initials, in my case MK and set its priority to high. To see the tasks open the task view (Windows -> Show View -> Tasks).<br>
