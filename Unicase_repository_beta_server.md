We use UNICASE to model UNICASE, also called boot strapping or eat-your-own-dogfood.<br>
To access the UNICASE repository where we host the UNICASE project, you need the internal release of UNICASE. This release is not available on our normal update site (external release), but on the beta update site at <a href='http://unicase.googlecode.com/svn/updatesite/internal/'>http://unicase.googlecode.com/svn/updatesite/internal/</a>.<br>

<b><i>NOTE: This release will be preconfigured to connect to our beta server.</i></b>
